# An example per-installation configuration file for Distil.

# This file should be copied to either your home directory, or the directory
# from which you run Distil, and renamed to ".distil.cfg".  You should modify
# the values of these variables as appropriate for your installation.


[Distil]

# The absolute (filesystem) path to the base of the "doclib" (document library)
# -- the directory, somewhere in an existing Git repository, in which Distil
# stores all the bib-files, documents, wiki-pages, auto-generated indices, etc.
#
# If the path begins with '~', this will be expanded to the appropriate user
# home-dir (according to the interpretation of 'os.path.expanduser').
#
# For example: /var/lib/distil/doclib (or) ~/Thesis/doclib
doclib_base_abspath = ~/Thesis/doclib


# A unique name (identifier) for this doclib.  This name should consist only of
# letters, numbers, hyphens, periods and underscores (any other characters will
# be removed).
#
# For now, this name is only used as the name of the symlink (in the "static"
# directory) to the DOCLIB_BASE_ABSPATH, enabling a single Distil installation
# to be used for multiple doclibs (by running multiple webservers in the same
# installation).
#
# In the future (ie, when I get around to it), this will also be incorporated
# into the URL path and password authentication, for the rest of what's needed
# to allow multiple Distil instances to run on the same system (on the same port).
# Currently, the password authentication part isn't handled (oops), but you can
# run multiple Distil instances simultanously by running them on different ports.

# The "cookie_secret" secret key to be supplied to Tornado for secure cookies:
#  http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation#cookies-and-secure-cookies
#
# The value of this variable is left intentionally blank, to encourage you
# to specify your own "unique" (and "secret") value, rather than simply using
# a well-known default (which would obviously not be "secret").
#
# To generate an appropriate value for this variable, perform the following
# operations in the Python interpreter:
#
#   import base64
#   import uuid
#   base64.b64encode(uuid.uuid4().bytes + uuid.uuid4().bytes)
#
# then copy-and-paste the resulting string into your ".distil.cfg" (and ensure
# the file permissions don't allow anyone other than you to read the file).
#
# (This method was recommended by Bret Taylor on 19th Sept, 2009, to generate
# "256 bits of randomness":
#  http://groups.google.com/group/python-tornado/browse_thread/thread/9ea50651adee1150 )
#
# This method will generate a different "unique" value every time you run it.
#
# If you don't specify a value for this variable, Distil will use this method
# to generate a secret key for you automatically, each time Distil is started.
# While this is convenient to get Distil up-and-running quickly, the downside
# is that the secret key will be different every time Distil is started, so
# your users will need to re-login every time Distil is re-started.

# The absolute (filesystem) path to an "htpasswd" file (including the filename)
# that contains the usernames and (SHA-1) htpasswd-encrypted passwords of
# authenticated Distil users.  (Ensure that the file permissions don't allow
# anyone other than you to read the file.)
#
# To create and edit this file, you can use the Apache 'htpasswd' utility.
# For SHA-1 password encryption, supply the "-s" command-line option.
#
# If the path begins with '~', this will be expanded to the appropriate user
# home-dir (according to the interpretation of 'os.path.expanduser').
#
# For example: /var/lib/distil/.htpasswd (or) ~/.distil-htpasswd
