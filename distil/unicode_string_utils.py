    # 1. Code-point 0x97 was causing an error:
    #   UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x97 in position 867373: invalid start byte
    # 
    # An explanation (Praise Be to Stack Overflow!):
    #
    # """In your case, fortunately, your error message makes it obvious. It's
    # almost sure bet that you are dealing with Microsoft's annoying cp1252,
    # due to the presence of a 0x97 character. In latin-1, this codepoint holds
    # a control character, "END OF GUARDED AREA" which is almost never used.
    # You will never see this precise error with utf-8 as 0x97 is not a valid
    # character-leading byte. In cp1252, on the other hand, it is the very
    # common emdash."""
    #  -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2508847/convert-or-strip-out-illegal-unicode-characters
    #
    # Also:
    #
    # """The confusion arises because character 151 is a dash in Windows code
    # page 1252 (Western European). Many people think cp1252 is the same thing
    # as ISO-8859-1, but in reality it's not: the characters in the C1 range
    # (128 to 159) are different."""
    #  -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/631406/what-is-the-difference-between-em-dash-151-and-8212
    #
    # Note that 0x97 is 151 in decimal, and 0x2014 is 8212.
    #
    #
    # 2. Next, code-point 0x92 was causing an error:
    #   UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x92 in position 882259: invalid start byte
    #
    # Also from Stack Overflow:
    #
    # """0x92 in CP-1252 (default Windows code page) is a backquote character,
    # which looks kinda like an apostrophe. This code isn't a valid ASCII
